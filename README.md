dwm - dynamic window manager
===

dwm is a tiling window manager, I like working efficiently and this fits my needs ! this is my own build of dwm the suckeless's WM.

### applied patches:

- patches are organized in branches, and the master branch had all other branches merged altogether ! it's the final build so far.
